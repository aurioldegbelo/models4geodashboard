		"body": "This work provides the implementation part of my bachelor-thesis. It was used to conduct a study about different interface designs in the context of geodashboards. More specifically it was about the particular interaction strategy of comparison. One wants to know the differences between two spatial features of the dataset. What are common interface design to face this issue in the context of geodashboards? The application provides 6 different approaches for comparing two or three spatial features."

All four datasets consist of values from the years of 2008 to 2022. The use of complex spatial-temporal data justifies the use of multiple coordinated views. In our case: Map, Graph, Table.
